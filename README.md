# SERVER SIDE / HOST ONLY

## Features
- **Global Upgrades Synchronization:** The mod now synchronizes upgrade levels for all players, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
- **Host-Only Requirement:** Only the game host needs the mod installed, streamlining the experience.
- **Enhanced Modded Upgrades Support:** Supports both official and modded upgrades.

---

## How It Works Now
- The mod maintains a central dictionary of upgrades and synchronizes upgrade levels for the entire team. This means that upgrade changes are applied globally rather than per player, greatly reducing synchronization issues.

---

## Future Plans
- None for now.

---

## Incompatibilities
- All upgrade synchronization mods.
